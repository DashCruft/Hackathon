Zeurus, a cross-platform blazingly fast code/text editor with Syntax Highlighting
</p>

<br>

## Installation

Installing Zeurus is very straight forward.<br>
Currently, Mac Support is pending due to the lack of testers.

Head over to the **[releases](https://github.com/DashCruft/Hackathon/releases)** and grab the `.msi` if you are on windows, `tar.zst` & `.deb` for Linux

## Development

If you'd like to compile Zeurus from source, please read the following: <br>

**REQUIREMENTS**<br> 
- node `v17` or higher (`v18.5` is tested on my end and seems to be the most compatible)<br>
- yarn because npm bad.

Once met requirements, do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/DashCruft/Hackathon.git && cd Hackathon
yarn install
```
To run Zeurus afterwards, do `yarn tauri:serve`
